### WINS!!

### CHALLENGES of the Project
The routing was easy because we used a MEAN boilerplate.  We did have a challenging trying to get Musixmatch API to render images, but we were able to stick to it. We wanted the emoji generator to connect with the lyrics and spit out emoji-styled lyrics.



### If we had another week....
We would want to still pursue the lyrics and emoji translator.
